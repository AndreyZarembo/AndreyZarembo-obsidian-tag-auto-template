# Obsidian Tag Auto Template Plugin (Alpha)

This plugin is for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

It embeds to header of the note content of any template from specified folder that has same tags. Just like [[https://github.com/dabravin/obsidian-dynamic-embed]] plugin but for any note with matching tags.

It seems to work with Meta Bind and DataView, so it's sutable to build CRM and Task management stuff. 

Works simple:
1) Create folder for templates
2) Put your template in this folder
3) Add the tag you want to apply template by to this template
4) Open note and add tag to it

## Alpha and issues

This plugin has some ploblems:
1) Sometimes it blinks on edit
2) It's renders not same as main editor
3) Not working in view mode
4) No weights or sorting of templates yet
5) Can't put Footer templates block, because text is constantly going below it on typing
6) Not working with some plugins like Buttons
